Because finding the optimal set of nodes is an NP-hard problem, several heuristic algorithms have been developed as alternative methods, for instance, the so-called belief propagation-based decimation (BPD) algorithm and the collective influence (CI) algorithm. Here, we test the performance of each of these algorithms and analyze them in the perspective of the fractality of the network. Networks are classified into two types: fractal and non-fractal networks. Real-world examples include the World Wide Web and Internet at the autonomous system level, respectively. They have different ratios of long-range shortcuts to short-range ones.

Because finding the optimal set of nodes is an NP-hard problem, several heuristic algorithms have been developed as alternative methods, for instance, the so-called belief propagation-based decimation (BPD) algorithm and the collective influence (CI) algorithm. Here, we test the performance of each of these algorithms and analyze them in the perspective of the fractality of the network. Networks are classified into two types: fractal and non-fractal networks. Real-world examples include the World Wide Web and Internet at the autonomous system level, respectively. They have different ratios of long-range shortcuts to short-range ones.

This extends a result of the first author, which corresponds to the independent case where $A$ and $B$ are product sets. We obtain a number of other results. For example, we show that if $X$ is a probability distribution on $G^m$ such that any two coordinates are uniform in $G^2$, then a pointwise product of $s$ independent copies of $X$ is nearly uniform in $G^m$, where $s$ depends on $m$ only. Extensions to other groups are also discussed.   We obtain closely related results in communication complexity, which is the setting where some of these questions were first asked by Miles and Viola. For example, suppose party $A_i$ of $k$ parties $A_1,\\dots,A_k$ receives on its forehead a $t$-tuple $(a_{i1},\\dots,a_{it})$ of elements from $G$.

We show that if $(a_1,\\ldots,a_t)$ and $(b_1,\\ldots,b_t)$ are sampled uniformly from large subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G^t$ then their interleaved product $a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 \\cdots a_t b_t$ is nearly uniform over $G$. This extends a result of the first author, which corresponds to the independent case where $A$ and $B$ are product sets. We obtain a number of other results. For example, we show that if $X$ is a probability distribution on $G^m$ such that any two coordinates are uniform in $G^2$, then a pointwise product of $s$ independent copies of $X$ is nearly uniform in $G^m$, where $s$ depends on $m$ only. Extensions to other groups are also discussed.   We obtain closely related results in communication complexity, which is the setting where some of these questions were first asked by Miles and Viola. For example, suppose party $A_i$ of $k$ parties $A_1,\\dots,A_k$ receives on its forehead a $t$-tuple $(a_{i1},\\dots,a_{it})$ of elements from $G$. The parties are promised that the interleaved product $a_{11}\\dots a_{k1}a_{12}\\dots a_{k2}\\dots a_{1t}\\dots a_{kt}$ is equal either to the identity $e$ or to some other fixed element $g\\in G$, and their goal is to determine which of the two the product is equal to. We show that for all fixed $k$ and all sufficiently large $t$ the communication is $\\Omega(t \\log |G|)$, which is tight. Even for $k=2$ the previous best lower bound was $\\Omega(t)$.

On longer timescales, agents coordinate via positive feedback to form patterns, which are defined using closed walks in the graph of agents. Patterns can be coherent, in that every part of the pattern depends on every other part for context. Coherent patterns are acausal, in that (a) they cannot be predicted and (b) no part of the stored knowledge can be mapped to any part of the pattern, or vice versa. A cognitive network's knowledge is encoded or embodied by the selection of patterns which emerge.

On longer timescales, agents coordinate via positive feedback to form patterns, which are defined using closed walks in the graph of agents. Patterns can be coherent, in that every part of the pattern depends on every other part for context. Coherent patterns are acausal, in that (a) they cannot be predicted and (b) no part of the stored knowledge can be mapped to any part of the pattern, or vice versa. A cognitive network's knowledge is encoded or embodied by the selection of patterns which emerge. The theory of cognition summarized here can model autocatalytic reaction-diffusion systems, artificial neural networks, market economies and ant colony optimization, among many other real and virtual systems. This theory suggests a new understanding of complexity as a lattice of contexts rather than a single measure.","relevant":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5aea850a5a59986e57287dbf"},"id":"arXiv:1805.00873v1","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00873v1","updated":"2018-04-27T12:44:04Z","published":"2018-04-27T12:44:04Z","title":"A Hybrid Q-Learning Sine-Cosine-based Strategy for Addressing the\n  Combinatorial Test Suite Minimization Problem","summary":"The sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) is a new population-based meta-heuristic algorithm.

This paper illustrates how Phylotastic has addressed the challenges of creating and refining phylogenetic analysis workflows using logic programming technology and how such solutions have been used within the general framework of the Phylotastic project.

We map the teachers' descriptions to perceptual reward detectors, and use them to train corresponding behavioural policies in simulation.We empirically show that our instructable agents (i) learn visual reward detectors using a small number of examples by exploiting hard negative mined configurations from demonstration dynamics, (ii) develop pick-and place policies using learned visual reward detectors, (iii) benefit from object-factorized state representations that mimic the syntactic structure of natural language goal expressions, and (iv) can execute behaviours that involve novel objects in novel locations at test time, instructed by natural language.","relevant":0},{"_id":{"$oid":"5aea850a5a59986e57287da8"},"id":"arXiv:1805.00178v1","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00178v1","updated":"2018-05-01T04:09:09Z","published":"2018-05-01T04:09:09Z","title":"Dynamic Sentence Sampling for Efficient Training of Neural Machine\n  Translation","summary":"Traditional Neural machine translation (NMT) involves a fixed training procedure where each sentence is sampled once during each epoch.

In this paper, we derive a mathematical formulation for set prediction using feed-forward neural networks, where the output has unknown and unfixed cardinality and permutation. Specifically, in our formulation we incorporate the permutation as unobservable variable and estimate its distribution during the learning process using alternating optimization. We demonstrate the validity of this formulation on two relevant problems including object detection and a complex CAPTCHA test.","author":["S. Hamid Rezatofighi","Roman Kaskman","Farbod T.
